# Project Days Analysis
This reporsitory contains analysis codes for Project days dataset (collected in Tallinn University) for understanding engagment in collaborative learning activities.

The learning activities were organized in Tallinn university. Estonian schools participated in the activities. A researcher and the teacher co-designed the learning activity. During the activity, following data were recorded in addition with the logs data which were obtained from Graasp logs (Participants used Graasp application for the activity).
* Looking at the screen
* Talking with the group members
* Interacting with the technology
* Interacting with the resources (e.g., paper, book)
* Interacting with external people (e.g., teacher, researcher)
* Disengaged
* Graasp logs (Open, Create, Access, Update)


## Analysis
For the analysis, I have used first dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, Factor analysis, MFA, MCA) to map the collected data into two dimensional data. Then, I interpreted the meaning of resultant dimensions of PCA using visualization techniques and correlation analysis.

Based on the analysis results, the final dimensions were used to further understand the collaborating groups' behavior.
